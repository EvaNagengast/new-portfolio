        Personal Author Website OBJECTIVE: Build a beautiful Portfolio about
        published work and recent releases ACHIEVED: I was lucky that Jane Corry
        trusted me to build her a personal homepage. The aim was to design the
        page based on her latest novel, the colour scheme was dark and gloomy
        and to greet the visitor I constructed a flashing light in the windows
        of the lakehouse, which proved harder than expected given the png
        wouldn't load before the flashing windows at first, but I was very
        proud, once it worked and gave the page a bit of a scary entry. Exactly
        what we planned for. I added a slideshow to showcase her Books and an
        extra section to present her reviews, which was important to her. During
        this project I learned a lot about Routers and Naviation and dived deep
        into the magic that can be created with React.

        Musical Journey through London OBJECTIVE: Learn how to use embeds,
        grids, and tables effectively. ACHIEVED: My favourite project so far,
        this page was a joy to develop and a fun exploration of London's music
        culture. I spent hours listening to songs named after London streets and
        boroughs while designing and curating the content. I illustrated playful
        elements like the "Way Out" button, and a moving TfL-Ticket after a 1991
        travel card. It also features embeds, grids, and tables, all seamlessly
        rendered responsive with the use of media queries.

        Dictionary App OBJECTIVE: Deepen knowledge about React.js, looping,
        mapping through objects, and utilising APIs and npm libraries. ACHIEVED:
        This project helped me to expand my expertise in React.js, focusing on
        looping and mapping through objects. It involved the creation of a
        dictionary app, rich with features like images related to the search
        term and an animated play buttons that talks to the user. The
        development process was a fun and educational journey, helping me to
        experiment with various npm libraries and to dive deeper into the
        functionality of React.

        Pigeon Showcase OBJECTIVE: I aimed to create a website that closely
        resembled a Figma design, incorporating grids and ensuring
        responsiveness. ACHIEVED: This project challenged me to dive into the
        world of responsive design. I recreated a webpage based on a Figma
        design, striving to stay as close to the original as possible while
        personalising the content as a tribute to pigeons. Using a combination
        of Bootstrap and media queries, I ensured that the site stays responsive
        and beautiful across all devices.

        Magic Weather App OBJECTIVE: Learn to use React.js and implement
        multiple components ACHIEVED: As my first React project I built a second
        Weather Application. Learning to use React was a steep learning curve.
        Very quickly I enjoyed building all the components and putting them
        together like a Puzzle. To add a unique touch and because autumn is
        near, I created individual Tarot-themed weather icons.

        Weather App OBJECTIVE: Build a functioning application, learn how to
        implement APIs and make a responsive website using Bootstrap. ACHIEVED:
        Building upon my previously-gained knowledge I constructed a Weather
        App. This project helped me to learn how to integrate and understand
        APIs, real-life development workflows, hosting, and to gain a deeper
        understanding of JavaScript. The App allows users to easily access
        up-to-date weather conditions and forecasts for locations all around the
        world. I had lots of fun styling the website in a Pop Art style.

        World Clock OBJECTIVE: Gain more experience with APIs, and especially
        handling and processing local times. ACHIEVED: My second big project was
        the development of a JavaScript World Clock App, also built using
        Bootstrap. This project helped me to deepen my API knowledge and refine
        my development skills. Implementing the time first seemed very hard, but
        I loved reading about calculations around UTC, how to work with it and
        to solve challenges creatively. I animated an indicator to show the
        seconds and move around the main spplication like a clock.
